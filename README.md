# DeepLearning-for-IDS

Deep learning approach for the IDS will be studied for this project. Deep learning is a subfield of AI that can make use of big data to learn and make decisions on its own. The legacy of Googleâ€™s AlphaGo encourages further study of the deep learning approach for the AI. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) will be trained by using the NSL-KDD dataset and the CICIDS 2017 datasets.
